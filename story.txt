Jack needs to study, but his friends have peer-pressured him to go to a local biergarten in Mitte, Berlin. When he arrives, he quickly is overwhelmed by the beautiful live musik playing throughout the tavern. It's Rammstein, his favorite band -- not many would describe it as beautiful but he really, really, really likes it. He got hungry so he decided to buy a Bratwurst, it was really good.
